This list would actually be fantastic if I was nearly as awesome as you and able to take a year off to backpack across South America, so thank you from everyone cooler than me (and thanks for making me jealous)."

      comment: "Medellin is the worst for flakey girls and many girls have a princessy attitude when you do happen to take them out – I usually avoid Medellin and Bogota, there are muchh better pickings in other places-…And sometimes there is some kind of weird ritual in parts of colombia(barranquilla, cali) like she really likes you so she is making herself supeerr pretty for you and taking forever say and extra 45 minutes to 3 hours, no joke (right and you sitting there fuming waiting for something that seems like its not going to happen). I think I figured out a few ways to prevent this..first off make her as excited to see you as possible..we’re not negotiating contracts here you’re trying te pique her interest..flirt, joke..be mysterious, maybe don’t show up once yourself ;) hints that other people(girls) are inviting you out==all of these do wonders for increasing interest. I usually pick a place near where I am as kind of the pre meeting place or a place near a ciber so I have something else to do. Oh and if its the first time you are meeting a girl you want ZERO pressure on her..no hun were just hanging out drinking a little of colombias finest coffee-If you have a trip to the zoo a flight to cartagena planned she might feel alot of pressure and finally decide to duck out. Of course after the coffee you might suggest the zoo and then you are low pressure AND spontaneous. .. And one last thing tip that took me along time to figure out…whats the right thing to do if she flakes on you? If you get angry usually its the nail in the coffin of that relationship..So what I do is call her later and apologize for not showing up…that will alleviate her guilt for standing you up and not make you look like a loser waiting around for nothing. Then if you still want to make another date its very likely she will show up."

I don’t understand why the USD conversion doesn’t correct this, but for whatever reason it doesn’t or the peso has gotten relatively stronger or something. I’ve talked to Americans that were here 2-3 years ago that say that prices (in dollars) have doubled or tripled since they were last here."

I don’t know how I’d represent modes of transportation, but all my travel has been on long distance buses with the exception of Seattle -> Quito and the trip to the Galapagos, which were both plane. I don’t think the mention of my parents traveling is a problem. I imagine that not many of their would-be evildoers are very close followers of my blog. ; )"

      comment: "I played carneval with the kids in my class last week with lots of water and spray foam. That was the first day of carneval. On the second day of carneval we painted faces during our activity time and my friend Liz helped. As we were painting faces, the kids went to her and said, “¡¿Quiere jugar carneval?!” She, confused said, “¡Si!” My students got very excited and ran to their backpacks to whip out the foam, but I was screaming, “No! Liz!!! You don’t know what you’re saying!” and explained what she had agreed to. Saved from the foam and water she was."

      comment: "<p>If you haven’t been scammed, you haven’t traveled. Next time, just be prepared to out-trick the tricksters. Carry around your own counterfeit bills just in case. I can foresee nothing going wrong with that.</p><p>When I was in Thailand, I just wanted to be able to walk around exploring like I could in Europe without someone asking me to come see a “Thai factory” to benefit the “Thai school children.” One day this guy asks me if I need directions, I say no, he insists on giving them to me, then calls over a tuk-tuk to take me there. I say no thanks, and then they give me a whole spiel about how it’s a special Thai holiday, so any tuk tuks with a red banner are free to ride in and they’ll give me a tour of the city. I know it’s a scam, but I’m like, hmmm I wonder if I can get a free ride out of this. So I said okay, but first I have to pick something up from my hotel. I went back, asked at the front desk whether or not this was a scam and if I would get my head chopped off if I went with them. The concierge said yes to the first, but no to the second. The “scam” was that they were going to take me to yet another one of these goddamn “Thai factories” in hopes that I’d buy some merchandise, and then the store owners would pay the tuk tuk drivers their gas money, but I’d still get to see the sites.</p><p>So I hopped in the tuk tuk and away we went. After each site, the tuk tuk driver would be driving along, and then he’d hit his head dramatically and go, “I’ve got the best idea! I’ll take you by this amazing Thai factory!” After the third time that this happened I said to him, “Look, let’s be honest here. I know you’re doing this for gas money. Cut the act, just drop me at these places, I’ll pretend to be interested for five minutes, you get your gas money, and then we can go. Okay?” Deal. And so I ended up having a great free tour of Bangkok.</p><p>This also lead to a joyous experience in one of these said Thai factories where a racist salesman asked if black people lived near me and I got to say, “Dude, they’re EVERYWHERE!” But that’s a story for another day.</p><p>Hmmm… not sure what my point here was. I guess…. take advantage of the scammers before they take advantage of you! Although, that’s also a good way to get killed…</p>"

And yes, when you get jn a place you say hi, in Peru. If you fail to do so, you are being disrespectful. I felt the same way you did, when I first arrived in the USA and people never said hi to anybody, anywhere! and I did not get upset. When you are visiting a Spanish speaking country, you expect people to speak perfect English? and if they have visitors from france, they will have to speak in French, too?. God!! . You were visiting a poor country, have some mercy!!!. How many items can you buy at the dollar store for $ 1.80? 5,8,15?. Can anybody expect first class Gym, and service for that amount?. THI IS SO SHOCKING!!!!!!!!."

      comment: "wow, i never thought a travel blog could ever be this interesting. If this is just practice, i can only begin to imagine how amazing a real pretentious blog will be! Please be sure to include an entry about the “native” cultures, which are really…my ancestors, it would mean a lot. Is your next practice blog going to be about Lynwood? I hear it’s a lot like Redmond, with more guns and drugs."

      comment: "This is just a practice comment, wherein I will attempt to applaud the author of the blog post for his intelligent observations, with which I agree wholeheartedly. Had he written anything contrary to my established and superior opinion set, I would have expressed my deference in more terse and crude manner. That not being the case, I’ll end my post by encouraging the author this doppleganger “Mike” to continue his blogging efforts, and I will be an active reader, looking forward to his future travelling wisdom and anecdotes."

      comment: "See, that just goes to show you what the unscrupulous natives will try to pull on unsuspecting tourists. That sandwich is clearly not just “grilled chicken” but is in fact “flattened pig meat” and frozen meat wafer, a clever substitute often plied on the unsuspecting. You gotta watch out for this type of scam ’cause they can see you coming a mile away. Redmond is famous for a seemingly casual vibe but is, in fact, a hotbed of explotative merchants. You did get all your shots, didn’t you?"
