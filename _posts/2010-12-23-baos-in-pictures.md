We left Quito for a few days to hang out in Baños, which is a small town known for its hot springs and a bunch of outdoorsy stuff like biking, hiking, ziplining. Here are some pictures.

Arriving in town after our 3 hour bus ride and trying to find a taxi.

We sprung the extra $4/night to get the room with a hammock.

This billboard is posted on the way to our hotel. I don’t know the translation, but it appears to be a beauty spa for dead people.

I ordered Nachos at this restaurant for dinner and they came out with a bunch of stale Doritos they’d put on a plate. Rachel complained, so they brought us another tray of fresh Doritos.

Yeah, what now, valley? We just ziplined the crap out of you!
